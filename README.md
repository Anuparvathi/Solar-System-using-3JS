# Solar-System-3js
Hello FRIENDS,
You can call me Anu.
With the help of ISA VESIT i was able to learn about some basics about three js and was able to work on 
a project named 'OUR SOLAR SYSTEM'.Basically this project helps us to understand how we are abl to observe a 
3d object on the screen simply with the help of mouse.In this project you will be able learn some basics of javascript and HTML.
